# Task Distribution

In a software engineering environment, the most efficient use of time is used by having specialists work on a specific module and then having those modules integrate when they're finished. Below is a tabulated distribution of tasks to make better use of our time.

We will be following a layered information system architecture to best manage the tasks. [Image](http://csis.pace.edu/~marchese/SE616_New/L6/L6_files/image022.png) for reference.
