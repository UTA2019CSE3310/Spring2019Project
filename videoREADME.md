# SuperChat Demo: Capacities and Possible Requirements

### Please see this [link] (https://youtu.be/8CLNm80ZJDc) for reference.

## Capacities

SuperChat, in its very primitive stage, is capable of handling more than one user. With a server established, one can log on if they know the port and the IP address of the server. This is a major drawback since the majority of the population knows close to nothing about computer networks. 

## Possible Requirements

SuperChat will probably need to be standardized in some form so that IP address and port scans are limited to a specific range. 

SuperChat will require people to identify themselves through a "nick".

SuperChat will require a lobby. This is already implemented through the first engagement with the server. 

Superchat will provide all of the previous messages. This is already implemented and can be proven with another demo.
